# Pre-requisites

Needs Retropie 4.3 - not tested on another version.  
It's based on a Recalbox overlays set - see credits below - so if you have Recalbox, just use the source.

Works for a 16:9 screen in 1920x1080 (1080p).

# Installation

- Open the "configs" shared folder on you retropie installation
- **Recommended**: backup the folder content
- Copy the content of the chosen "configs_xxx" folder into the share and overwrite the files.

# Customization

If you want to use a shader on the portable consoles, there are both the gridded and gridless overlays in `config_shaders/all/retroarch/overlay/systems/`.
Just overwrite the images in the folder with what you want.

If you want to use another shader than `crt-pi-curvature` (or disable it), edit the `configs_shaders/xxx/xxx.cfg` where "xxx" is the system name (megadrive, nes...).

I have just moved files around to adapt the pack for Retropie.

Usage of the pack in a commercial product is strictly forbidden.

# Pre-requisites

Needs Retropie 4.3 - not tested on another version.  
It's based on a Recalbox overlays set and ghogan42's shaders - see credits below.

Works for a 16:9 screen in 1920x1080 (1080p).

# Installation

- Open the `configs` shared folder on you retropie installation
- **Recommended**: backup the folder content
- Copy the content of the `configs` folder into the share and overwrite the files.

# Customization

If you want to use another shader than the ones configured (or disable it), edit the `configs_shaders/xxx/xxx.cfg` where "xxx" is the system name (megadrive, nes...).

I have just moved files around to adapt the pack for Retropie.

Usage of the pack in a commercial product is strictly forbidden.

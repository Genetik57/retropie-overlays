# Retropie overlays pack

Overlays (or bezels) are images added "above" the emulator, to mask the black borders around the image.

This pack adds overlays for most systems emulated by Retropie.  
While you're here, it also configures appropriate shaders to make your games extra good-looking.

## Requirements

- Retropie 4.3 - not tested on another version.
- A 16:9 screen doing at least 720p. This pack is useless on a 4:3 screen, since you don't have black borders.
- The configuration is optimized to work on a Raspbery Pi 3. It will work on more powerful hardware, but maybe not on less.

## Installation

- Open the `configs` shared folder on you retropie installation (`\\retropie\configs\` on Windows, `smb://retropie/configs` on Mac)
- **Recommended:** backup the folder content!
- Copy the content of the chosen overlays folder into the share, and overwrite the files.
